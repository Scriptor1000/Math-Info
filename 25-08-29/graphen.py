Graph Theory Implementation

This module provides classes and algorithms for working with directed graphs.
It includes implementations for:
- Basic graph operations (vertex and edge management)
- Graph property checks (reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, transitive)
- Eulerian circle detection and finding
- Hamiltonian circle detection and finding

Classes:
    Vertex: Represents a vertex in a graph
    Graph: Represents a directed graph with various algorithms
